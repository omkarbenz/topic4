            <ul>
                <b>For a smart building IoT application, a control interface should have the following high-level
                    features:</b>
                <li>User-friendly interface: The interface should be easy to navigate and use for building
                    administrators,
                    facility managers, and end-users.</li>
                <li>Real-time monitoring: The interface should provide real-time monitoring of the building systems such
                    as
                    HVAC, lighting, and security.</li>
                <li>Remote control: The interface should allow users to remotely control building systems, such as
                    adjusting
                    the temperature or turning on lights.</li>
                <li>Energy management: The interface should provide energy management features, such as setting energy
                    efficiency goals, monitoring energy usage, and controlling energy-consuming systems.</li>
                <li>Alerts and notifications: The interface should provide alerts and notifications for issues such as
                    system failures, energy usage thresholds, and security breaches.</li>
                <li>Data analytics: The interface should provide data analytics, such as occupancy patterns and energy
                    usage
                    patterns, to help building administrators make informed decisions about building operations.</li>

                    devices
                    and provides the control interface.</li>
                <li>Data management system: A system for managing and organizing the data collected by the IoT devices.
                </li>
                <li>User authentication and authorization: A system for authenticating users and authorizing access to
                    the
                    control interface and building systems.</li>
